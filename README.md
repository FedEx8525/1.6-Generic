# 1.6-Generic

## 📄Exercises Level 1 and 2 of Sprint1 Task 6

### Level1 Exercice1 :

Develop a non-generic class that manages and verifies the initialization of three homogeneous objects:

  * Create a Class named NoGenericMethods.
  * Declare three variables to store objects of the same type.
  * Create a constructor to initialize all three variables.
  * Implement three methods to extract (get) each object individually.
  * Implement three methods to store (set) each object individually.
  * Ensure the constructor correctly handles initialization regardless of the argument order passed to it.

### Level1 Exercise 2

Implement a multi-type generic method to demonstrate flexible argument handling:

  * Create a Class named Persona with the attributes: nombre (String), apellido (String), and edad (int).
  * Create a Class named GenericMethods.
  * Inside GenericMethods, create a generic method that accepts three arguments of different generic types (e.g., <T, U, V>).
  * The generic method must simply print the three arguments it received to the console.
  * In the main execution (main()), call the generic method from GenericMethods three times,
  *  demonstrating its flexibility by passing a diverse set of arguments in any order, such as:
    * An object of the Persona class.
    * A String.
    * A primitive type (e.g., an int or double).
  
### Level2 Exercise 1

  * Modify the previous exercise so that one of the arguments of the generic method is not generic.

### Level2 Exercise 2

  * Modify the previous section so that the arguments of the generic method are a list of arguments of undefined variables.
